# Python Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Data Science Portfolio!


## Key Findings
- The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with 3 different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
- The average sepal length varies among the different species, with setosa having the shortest and virginica having the longest sepal length.
- There is a <span style="color: green;">positive correlation</span> between sepal length and petal length, indicating that as the sepal length increases, the petal length also tends to increase.

## Further Explorations
This portfolio represents a small portion of my work. In addition to the Iris dataset, I have experience working with various other datasets and performing <span style="color: blue;">advanced data analysis techniques</span>. Feel free to explore my other projects on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/Shalini-Nanda-ds) for more details.
